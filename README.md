This project contains the final system validation code and tests for the CMU MRSD 2020 project done by Team STARS(Team H)

Full details about the whole project can be found here - https://mrsdprojects.ri.cmu.edu/2020teamh/

This system contains multiple "tests" that help evaluate the overall system, the individual subsystems and their internal code against the project requirements that were defined early on during the analysis and requirement gathering stage.
